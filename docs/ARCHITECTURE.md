# Bauer architecture (current)

## Architecture (code organization)

At a high level, Bauer is a CLI with three core subsystems: Google Docs extraction, prompt generation, and Copilot execution.

- cmd/bauer/main.go: CLI entry point and the end-to-end orchestrator.
- internal/config: flag parsing + validation for `--doc-id`, `--credentials`, `--chunk-size`, `--output-dir`, `--dry-run`, `--model`, `--summary-model`, `--page-refresh`.
- internal/gdocs: Google Docs/Drive client + extraction pipeline.
  - service.go: auth + API clients.
  - extraction.go: fetch doc, walk document tree, build structure/anchors.
  - grouping.go: group and merge suggestions by location and ID.
  - types.go: data contracts for suggestions, metadata, and structure.
  - comments.go: Drive comments fetch (currently not wired into the main flow).
- internal/prompt: prompt engine + embedded instruction templates.
  - templates/: copy-docs + page-refresh instructions, plus Vanilla pattern references.
- internal/copilotcli: Copilot SDK wrapper to run each chunk and (optionally) generate a summary.

## How the flow operates (implementation details)

    A[CLI start] --> B[Load config + validate]
    B --> C[Init GDocs client]
    C --> D[Fetch doc with SUGGESTIONS_INLINE]
    D --> E[Extract raw suggestions]
    E --> F[Build doc structure + metadata]
    F --> G[Build actionable suggestions]
    G --> H[Group by location + merge by ID]
    H --> I[Include metadata table suggestions]
    I --> J[Render chunk prompts]
    J --> K{Dry run?}
    K -- Yes --> L[Write outputs + stop]
    K -- No --> M[Start Copilot CLI]
    M --> N[Execute chunks sequentially]
    N --> O{>1 chunk?}
    O -- Yes --> P[Generate summary session]
    O -- No --> Q[Done]
```

A few specifics worth knowing:

- Google Docs is fetched in `SUGGESTIONS_INLINE` mode so insertions/deletions are embedded in the document tree.
- Style suggestions are currently skipped entirely (only insert/delete operations become actionable suggestions).
- Anchor text is generated from the surrounding document text to help Copilot find exact matches.
- Suggestions are grouped first by logical location (section + heading + table), then merged by suggestion ID to form a single change.
- Metadata table suggestions are included; downstream tools should map them via metadata tags in the target repo.
- Chunking is by number of location groups (not “suggestions per chunk”).
- Each chunk file includes: instructions → Vanilla pattern references → JSON suggestions.
- Copilot runs one session per chunk, streaming output to the terminal; summary is a separate session only when there are multiple chunks.

## Understanding the output files

- bauer-log.json: JSON logs (debug-level) for the entire run.
- bauer-doc-suggestions.json: Full `ProcessingResult` (document metadata + actionable + grouped suggestions). Useful for debugging or re-running prompt generation.
- bauer-output/chunk-X-of-Y.md: One prompt per chunk. Each file embeds the instruction template, Vanilla patterns reference, and the JSON suggestions for that chunk.
